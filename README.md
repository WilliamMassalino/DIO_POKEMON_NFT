## Introduction

This project is a hands-on tutorial for blockchain enthusiasts and Pokémon fans alike. Using Solidity, IPFS, and Ethereum's development tools such as Remix IDE, Ganache, and MetaMask, participants will learn how to deploy and interact with a smart contract that manages Pokémon NFTs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - For a personal Ethereum blockchain
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - For Solidity development

### Steps

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <(https://github.com/WilliamMassalino/DIO_POKEMON_NFT>)
```

Install the required Node.js dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
